# Step 1: Ask 

## Business task

## Key Questions

1. _What are some trends in smart device usage?_
2. _How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?_
3. _How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?_

# Step 2: Prepare

## Data description:

- File type: CSV files (there is a total of 18 datasets)
- Data size: 30 samples
- Data format: Long data
- Data duration: 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016

## Data source:

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on [Kaggle]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) in 18 CSV files. The data contains smart health data from personal fitness trackers for thirty fitbit users. The data was collected via a survey of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, hear rate, and sleep monitoring, through Amazon Mechanical Turk between March 12, 2016 and May 12, 2016.

## Credibility of the data:

ROCCC (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current & Cited) data test model applied in order to determine the credibility and reliability of the dataset:

- Reliable ‚Äî LOW ‚Äî Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents.
- Original ‚Äî LOW ‚Äî Third party provider (Amazon Mechanical Turk).
- Comprehensive ‚Äî MEDIUM ‚ÄîData is within the parameters required for the Bellabeat‚Äôs business task.
- Current ‚Äî LOW ‚Äî Data was sourced in 2016 (8 years old) and is not relevant.
- Cited ‚Äî LOW ‚ÄîThe third-party dataset was available by Mobius via Kaggle.

## Loading packages

I'm going to install all the necessary packages and their libraries.

```
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

The Skimr package makes summarizing data really easy.

```
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
```

The Janitor package has functions for cleaning data.
```
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)
```

```
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

The HERE package makes referencing files easier.

```
install.packages("here")
library("here")
```

## Importing the datasets

```
activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
calories <- read.csv("dailyCalories_merged.csv")
intensities <- read.csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
steps <- read.csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight <- read.csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```
## Checking the datasets

After importing the datasets, I used the following functions to preview the data and ensure they were imported correctly:
- head()
- str()

```
head(activity)
str(activity)
```

```
head(calories)
str(calories)
```

```
head(intensities)
str(intensities)
```

```
head(steps)
str(steps)
```

```
head(sleep)
str(sleep)
```

```
head(weight)
str(weight)
```

## Findings

- Date values are formatted as chr, which needs to be transformed into the correct date/time format.
- Column names are in inconsistent format, which needs to be renamed to make further analysis easier.

# Step 3: Process

## Converting column names and fixing date formats

### activity

```
activity_new <- activity %>%
  rename_with(tolower) %>% #convert column names to lowercase
  mutate(activitydate = as.Date(activitydate, format="%m/%d/%Y")) #fixing date formats
str(activity_new) #preview the result
```
